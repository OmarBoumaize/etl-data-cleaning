# ETL Data Cleaning & Transformation

This project demonstrates the **data cleaning and transformation phase** of an ETL pipeline.  

The workflow includes:  
- Detecting and analyzing **messy or inconsistent data**   
- Cleaning and standardizing fields such as **names, dates, phone numbers, addresses, and blood groups**  
- Using **regex** to parse concatenated information  
- Enriching data by predicting missing values (e.g., gender)  
- Preparing datasets for **loading into a structured system**

## Technologies
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Regex, Scikit-learn  
- MYSQL/PYSQL for extraction  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/willOmar1/etl-data-cleaning.git
